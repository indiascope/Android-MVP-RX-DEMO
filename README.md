# Android-MVP-RX-DEMO
This is a sample Android app to showcase MVP Android architecture with RxAndroid, Retrofit 2.0, ButterKnife. 

I create this boilerplate for all the little apps I create. I'm kind of tired of doing it. Now it's opensource and meant to
serve as a reference to the must have tools when you start building a new android app.

##  What are all the tools used ?
1. RxJava
2. RxAndroid
3. Timber
4. Retrofit 2.0
5. Butterknife
6. Android platform data binding
7. GSON
8. Stetho
9. Firebase Job Dispatcher

##  What does this app do ?
This app is a basic stock tracker that shows you  the current stock price, lowest intraday price, highest intraday price and 
the price history based on the data provided from https://www.alphavantage.co/.
